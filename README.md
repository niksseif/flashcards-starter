# FlashCards 
Overview:  This is a command-line-interface (CLI) game of flashcards. You will start it up in your command line, and then 
you'll see questions with a few possible answers (one question at a time). Click on a number to select your answer, and 
that will be highlighted. Press enter to submit your final answer. You'll then see whether you were right or not! After 
you've gone through all the questions, you'll see your percentage correct score.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). 

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can play the game, or if you're a nerd like me, run some awesome unit tests on the whole repository.
  * To run the game itself, run `node index.js` in your terminal (from the root of your project).
  * To run unit tests, run `npm test` in your terminal.

Here is a nice little gif showing how the game is played:
